<p>Decision trees are models whose structure allows for tracing an explanation of how the final decision was taken. Neural networks known as ’black box’ model, do not readily and explicitly offer an explanation of how the decision was reached. However since Neural Networks are capable of learning knowledge representation it will be very useful to develop methods that interpret the model’s decisions.
In this project Activation Maximisation will be used to search for prototypical inputs that maximise the model’s response for a quantity of interest. A pair-wise prototype comparison is then carried out under different learning conditions, such as number of classes the model deals with. The study is grounded in the area of object spatial relations recognition in images and will shed light on what models are learning about objects in 2D images which should give insight into how the system can be improved.
The spatial relation problem is one where given a subject and an object the correct spatial preposition is predicted. This problem extends beyond just predicting one correct spatial preposition as there are mulitple possible relationships associated between two objects.</p>
