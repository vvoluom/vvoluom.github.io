# LinkPal - Decentralized ETH escrow for ETH/FIAT trading using PayPal.

## Abstract
Ethereum based smart contracts have no way to communicate with outside data which makes them limited in the ability to verify the information that is being given to them. The Chainlink network provides 
a reliable tamper-proof way to input and retrieve data from these smart contracts. Using this new technology LinkPal was created with the purpose of trading ETH for Fiat and vice versa without having to trust either party or a centralised provider. All the transactions are done through the smart contract and the PayPal verifications are done by Chainlink's decentralised oracles.

## Motivation
This project was done as a hackathon submission for the Coinlist Chainlink hackathon. The problem that is solved by LinkPal is the "Who goes first" problem while transacting digital goods online during Peer-to-Peer trading. It also removes having to trust a centralised authority to facilitate your data and payments. This solution currently only uses PayPal which is prone to the abuse of chargebacks, other payment methods will be incorporated in the future.

## Technologies and Services Used.
# Ethereum
Ethereum is a decentralised platform for smart contracts built using blockchain technology. It is currently run using a Proof of Work (POW) consensus mechanism where transactions are confirmed by miners solving cryptographic hashes to gain rewards.

# Smart Contracts
Smart Contracts provide the ability to execute tamper-proof digital agreements, which are considered highly secure and highly reliable. Smart contracts on the Ethereum Blockchain are coded using the programming language Solidity which is high-level and object-oriented.

# Chainlink
Chainlink facilitates the retrieval of reliable and tamper-proof information from and to smart contracts. It does this in a decentralised way by sending and retrieving information from multiple nodes. The data that is received by the majority of the nodes is what the smart contract agrees on as the correct data.

# PayPal
PayPal is an e-commerce compnay that facilitates payments between parties through online funds transfers.
